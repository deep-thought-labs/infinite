name: Push to Buf Schema Registry
# This workflow runs when a new version tag is pushed to the repository.
# It then pushes the Protobuf files corresponding to that tag on to the
# Buf Schema Registry at https://buf.build/cosmos/evm
#
# NOTE: This workflow requires BUF_TOKEN secret to be configured in GitHub.
# If you're not using Buf Schema Registry, disable this workflow or configure the token.
# See: guides/GITHUB_BUF_TOKEN_SETUP.md for setup instructions
