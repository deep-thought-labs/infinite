## Infinite Improbability Drive

### **Network Identity**
- **Chain Name**: `infinite`
- **Chain ID**: `infinite_421018-1`
- **Bech32 Prefix**: `infinite`

### **Token: Improbability**
- **Token Name**: Improbability
- **Symbol**: `42`
  - *Just 42. If you want to know why, we invite you to consult the [Enciclopedia Galáctica](https://grokipedia.com/page/42_(number)) for more information.*
- **Token Format**: Improbability [42]

### **Unit of Measurement: cups**
The Improbability token is measured in **cups** (cups of Improbability), because **improbability is the fuel that powers the Infinite Improbability Drive**. The atomic unit is **drop**.

- **1 cup** = 1 cup of Improbability
- **1 cup** = 1 [42]
- **1 cup** = 1 Improbability [42]
- **1 cup** = 1 tasa de improbabilidad

> **Note:** This friendly nomenclature is intentional, not meant to confuse. Some readers' heads explode when they hear "a forty-two," but they relax when you mention "a cup of Improbability." We use this approach to make the tokenomics more accessible and approachable.

### **Equivalencies**
- **1 Improbability [42]** = **1 cup** (1 cup of Improbability / 1 tasa de improbabilidad)
- **1 cup** = **10¹⁸ drop**
- **1 drop** = **10⁻¹⁸ Improbability [42]** = **10⁻¹⁸ cup**

**Examples:**
- `10 cups` = 10 Improbability [42]
- `50 cups` = 50 Improbability [42]
- `100 cups of Improbability` = 100 Improbability [42]

### **The Infinite Improbability Drive: A Philosophical Foundation**

> *"The Infinite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a second, without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace."* — The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

The **Infinite Improbability Drive** is the engine that powers this network—both literally and metaphorically. In Douglas Adams' universe, the drive operates by generating improbability: when it reaches infinite improbability, it passes through every conceivable point in every conceivable universe simultaneously. It doesn't move through space conventionally; instead, it **warps probability itself**, causing highly improbable events to occur.

#### **How It Works: Improbability as Fuel**

The drive is created by connecting a Bambleweeny 57 Sub-Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer—specifically, a **hot cup of tea**. The student who invented it realized that since an infinite improbability machine was "virtually impossible," it must have finite improbability. By feeding that improbability figure into a finite improbability generator and adding hot tea (which provides the Brownian Motion necessary to generate the improbability field), the device was born.

**In our network, each cup of Improbability [42] is the improbability itself**—the raw fuel that powers the drive. When you hold a cup of Improbability, you're holding the fundamental force that makes the impossible possible, that bends probability to cross vast distances, that transforms the highly unlikely into reality.

#### **Improbability and Entropy: The Cosmic Dance**

Both Douglas Adams and Isaac Asimov explored the relationship between improbability and entropy—the measure of disorder in the universe. Asimov, in his Foundation series, described psychohistory as predicting the future through the statistical behavior of large populations, where individual improbabilities average out into predictable patterns. Adams, in his satirical genius, took this concept to its absurd conclusion: if you can generate enough improbability, you can make anything happen.

**Improbability is the counterforce to entropy.** While entropy drives the universe toward disorder and decay, improbability introduces the possibility of order emerging from chaos, of structure forming from randomness, of the highly unlikely becoming reality. In the Infinite Improbability Drive, this manifests as the ability to be everywhere at once—to exist in all possible states simultaneously, until probability collapses into a single, chosen reality.

#### **The Network as Infinite Improbability Drive**

Our blockchain network operates on the same principle: through the collective improbability of decentralized consensus, we create order from the chaos of distributed systems. Each validator contributes to the improbability field. Each transaction is an improbable event made certain through cryptographic proof. Each block is a moment where probability collapses into consensus—where the infinite possibilities of the network state converge into a single, verifiable truth.

**Every cup of Improbability [42] you hold is a quantum of this force**—a measure of the improbability that makes our network possible, that allows us to build infrastructure that cannot be controlled, that powers a cypherpunk nation in cyberspace.

## Tokenomics – Pool Allocation (Executive Summary)

**Total Supply (Initial):** `100,000,200 Improbability [42]`** (100,000,200 cups)**  
- **Circulating (Liquid):** `200 Improbability [42]`** (200 cups) – Distributed at genesis (see [Genesis Bootstrap](#genesis-bootstrap-200-42) for details)  
- **Locked (Vesting):** `100,000,000 Improbability [42]`** (100,000,000 cups) – Released gradually over **42 years**, controlled by on-chain DAO  

**Why 100 Million Tokens?**  
Just like we use **100 tokens** in genesis for easy percentage visualization (40 tokens = 40%), we use **100 million tokens** as the total supply because it makes it **intuitively easy to understand** the project's lifecycle and market cap evolution:
- **Percentage calculations are straightforward**: 40% = 40 million, 25% = 25 million, etc.
- **Market cap tracking is simple**: At any price point, you can easily calculate total market cap
- **Supply growth is transparent**: As tokens unlock and inflation adds new tokens, the math remains clear and verifiable
- **No "magic numbers"**: Using a round number (100M) makes the tokenomics more accessible and easier to communicate

**Sole Controller:** On-chain DAO from block 1, with lab oversight on development operations  
**Inflation:** Dynamic, target-bonded, and governance-adjustable

| **Pool** | **ModuleAccount** | **% of Supply** | **Tokens Locked** | **Operational Mandate** |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **A** | `strategic_delegation` | 40% | 40,000,000 Improbability [42] (40M cups) | Never spent — only delegated to validators |
| **B** | `security_rewards` | 25% | 25,000,000 Improbability [42] (25M cups) | Validator + staker rewards |
| **C** | `perpetual_rd` | 15% | 15,000,000 Improbability [42] (15M cups) | Institutional funding (Deep Thought Labs) |
| **D** | `fish_bootstrap` | 10% | 10,000,000 Improbability [42] (10M cups) | Seed liquidity pools |
| **E** | `privacy_resistance` | 7% | 7,000,000 Improbability [42] (7M cups) | ZK, anti-censura R&D |
| **F** | `community_growth` | 3% | 3,000,000 Improbability [42] (3M cups) | Grants, education, integrations |
| **TOTAL** | - | **100%** | **100,000,000 Improbability [42]** (100M cups) | - |

> **Note**: All pools are implemented as ModuleAccounts in genesis. The table above shows the **locked tokens** (100,000,000) that will unlock over 42 years. For detailed configuration and technical implementation, see the [official documentation](https://docs.infinitedrive.xyz/en/blockchain/module-accounts).

### **Genesis Bootstrap (200 [42])**

At **Block 1**, exactly **200 Improbability [42]** (200 cups) are minted as liquid tokens and distributed as follows:

#### **100 [42] → Initial Validator Set**
- **Purpose:** Bootstrap the network and enable immediate block production
- **Distribution:** Held by the initial validator, who distributes them pro-rata to the **first set of validators** as they join the chain
- **Function:** As new validators join, they receive tokens from this pool to enable staking and block production
- **From this seed, inflation begins**, and the network self-sustains

#### **100 [42] → Tokenomics Pools (ModuleAccounts)**
- **Purpose:** Provide **visual clarity and educational understanding** of the tokenomics distribution
- **Distribution:** Split proportionally across all 6 pools according to their tokenomics percentages:
  - **Pool A (40%):** `40 [42]` → `strategic_delegation`
  - **Pool B (25%):** `25 [42]` → `security_rewards`
  - **Pool C (15%):** `15 [42]` → `perpetual_rd`
  - **Pool D (10%):** `10 [42]` → `fish_bootstrap`
  - **Pool E (7%):** `7 [42]` → `privacy_resistance`
  - **Pool F (3%):** `3 [42]` → `community_growth`
- **Why 100 tokens?** This makes it **intuitively easy to understand** the distribution:
  - When you see `40 [42]` in the genesis file or on-chain, you immediately understand it represents **40% of the total allocation**
  - The numbers directly correspond to percentages, making the tokenomics **visually transparent** from day one
  - Anyone can verify the distribution by simply looking at the balances: 40 + 25 + 15 + 10 + 7 + 3 = 100

> **Complete Supply at Genesis:**  
> - **200 Improbability [42] liquid** (200 cups: 100 for validators + 100 for tokenomics pools visibility)  
> - **100,000,000 Improbability [42] locked** (100M cups) in vesting accounts (unlock linearly over 42 years)  
> - **Total: 100,000,200 Improbability [42]** (100,000,200 cups)  
> The 100 tokens in ModuleAccounts are **governed by the DAO** and represent the initial liquid allocation visible at chain launch.

### **Dynamic Inflation Model (Target-Bonded with Gradual Adjustment)**

#### **Initial Configuration**
- **Initial Inflation:** Starts at `10%` annually on circulating supply  
- **Target Stake Ratio:** `67%` of total liquid supply staked (`goal_bonded`)  
- **Inflation Bounds (Initial):**  
  - **Minimum:** `7%` annually (`inflation_min`)  
  - **Maximum:** `20%` annually (`inflation_max`)  
- **Automatic Adjustment (Per Block):**  
  - Inflation adjusts **each block** based on actual bonded ratio vs. target  
  - If **bonded ratio < 67%** → inflation **increases** (up to max `20%`)  
  - If **bonded ratio = 67%** → inflation **stays constant**  
  - If **bonded ratio > 67%** → inflation **decreases** (down to min `7%`)  
  - Rate of change: `13%` per year maximum (`inflation_rate_change`)  
  - Formula: `inflationRateChange = (1 - bondedRatio/goalBonded) × inflationRateChange`  

#### **Long-Term Strategy: Gradual Parameter Reduction (Bitcoin-Style)**

To maintain a **controlled and limited supply** while ensuring network security, we implement a **3-phase gradual adjustment strategy** via DAO governance:

**Phase 1: Initial Growth (Years 1-5)**
- **Initial Inflation:** `10%` annually
- **Bounds:** `7%` min, `20%` max
- **Objective:** Maximum incentives for validators, network security, and organic growth
- **Expected Supply Growth:** ~240K - 1.5M tokens/year (as circulating supply grows from 2.4M to 11.9M)

**Phase 2: Controlled Growth (Years 5-15) - Via Governance**
- **Proposed Reductions (via DAO proposals):**
  - **Year 5:** Reduce `inflation_min` to `5%`, `inflation_max` to `15%`
  - **Year 10:** Reduce `inflation_min` to `3%`, `inflation_max` to `10%`
- **Objective:** Control supply growth while maintaining sufficient validator incentives
- **Expected Supply Growth:** ~950K - 2.9M tokens/year (as circulating supply grows from 11.9M to 23.8M)

**Phase 3: Mature Network (Years 15+) - Via Governance**
- **Proposed Reductions (via DAO proposals):**
  - **Year 15:** Reduce `inflation_min` to `3%`, `inflation_max` to `7%`
  - **Years 20+:** Maintain minimum sustainable inflation (3-5% min, 7-10% max)
- **Objective:** Limited and controlled supply (Bitcoin-style), minimal sustainable incentives
- **Expected Supply Growth:** ~1.4M - 7M tokens/year (as circulating supply grows from 47.6M to 100M)

**Total Expected Supply (42 years with gradual adjustment):** ~150-200M tokens  
**vs without adjustment (10% constant):** ~300M+ tokens

#### **Governance Mechanism**

Parameter adjustments are implemented via **on-chain parameter change proposals**:
- **Proposal Type:** `MsgUpdateParams` for mint module
- **Decision Criteria:** Based on circulating supply, staking ratio, network health metrics
- **Frequency:** Every 2-5 years, aligned with network maturity phases
- **Flexibility:** DAO can adjust timing and values based on real-world conditions

**Governance Override:** DAO can adjust at any time via **on-chain parameter change proposals**:  
  - `inflation_min` and `inflation_max` (bounds)  
  - `goal_bonded` (target stake ratio)  
  - `inflation_rate_change` (adjustment sensitivity)

> **Note:** This strategy ensures a **gradual and limited supply** (Bitcoin-style) while maintaining network security through adequate validator incentives. The automatic per-block adjustment responds to staking ratios, while the gradual parameter reduction (via governance) controls long-term supply growth.

### **Market Birth & Liquidity Path**
1. **Block 1:** `200 Improbability [42]` (200 cups) liquid:
   - `100 [42]` (100 cups) → initial validator (distributes to first validator set)
   - `100 [42]` (100 cups) → tokenomics pools (40+25+15+10+7+3, visible on-chain)
2. **Staking begins** → validators start producing blocks  
3. **Inflation kicks in** → new tokens minted per block  
4. **Year 1+:** Pools unlock gradually over 42 years → delegated/spent via DAO governance  
5. **Validators control market release** → Bitcoin-style organic liquidity

---

### **Perpetual Commitment**
- **All pools unlock gradually over 42 years**, aligned with operational horizons  
- **DAO governs destination of every unlock and inflation stream**  
- **Lab retains operational control over Pool C (perpetual_rd)**  
- **Each pool’s ModuleAccounts are continuously refilled via block fees + inflation**  
- **No token enters circulation without validator custody first**  
- **Security, alignment, and long-term resilience from genesis**

---

### **Technical Implementation**

All tokenomics pools are implemented as **ModuleAccounts** in genesis. For complete technical documentation on genesis configuration, ModuleAccounts, vesting accounts, and network parameters, see the [official documentation](https://docs.infinitedrive.xyz/en/blockchain).

## Run a Node

### Option 1: Using Drive (Recommended)

The easiest way to run a node is using **[Drive](https://github.com/deep-thought-labs/drive)**, the infrastructure management client for **Infinite Improbability Drive**:

**For Mainnet:**
```bash
# 1. Clone Drive repository
git clone https://github.com/deep-thought-labs/drive.git
cd drive

# 2. Navigate to mainnet service directory
cd services/node0-infinite

# 3. Start the container
./drive.sh up -d

# 4. Initialize the node (first time only)
./drive.sh node-ui
# Then in the interface: Advanced Operations → Initialize Node (Simple)
# Or via command line (simplified syntax):
./drive.sh node-init

# 5. Start the node
./drive.sh node-start
# Or via interface: Node Operations → Start Node

# 6. Open graphical interface (for management)
./drive.sh node-ui
```

**For Testnet:**
```bash
# Same steps, but use testnet service directory
cd drive/services/node1-infinite-testnet
./drive.sh up -d
./drive.sh node-ui
# Follow same initialization and startup steps
```

**Key Points:**
- Use `./drive.sh` for all commands (automatically handles permissions and detects service name)
- **Simplified syntax:** `./drive.sh node-start` (no need to specify `exec` or service name)
- The `node-init` command automatically downloads the official genesis file from the configured URL
- Use `node-ui` for a graphical interface that guides you through all operations
- See [Drive Documentation](https://github.com/deep-thought-labs/drive) for complete guides

> **Note:** The simplified syntax (`./drive.sh node-start`) is available from Drive v0.1.12+. For earlier versions, use the complete syntax: `./drive.sh exec infinite node-start`

### Option 2: Direct Installation

For direct installation from source (requires compiling the binary and obtaining the genesis file):

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/deep-thought-labs/infinite.git
cd infinite

# 2. Compile the binary
make install
# This installs infinited to $HOME/go/bin/infinited

# 3. Initialize the node (generates basic genesis)
infinited init my-node --chain-id infinite_421018-1 --home ~/.infinited

# 4. Obtain the official genesis file from URL
curl -o ~/.infinited/config/genesis.json \
  https://assets.infinitedrive.xyz/mainnet/genesis.json

# 5. Validate the genesis file
infinited genesis validate-genesis --home ~/.infinited

# 6. Start the node
infinited start --home ~/.infinited
```

**Important Notes:**
- For mainnet/testnet, you must compile the binary and obtain the official genesis file with Infinite Drive's complete configuration
- See the [official documentation](https://docs.infinitedrive.xyz/en/blockchain/genesis) for complete guides on genesis files, ModuleAccounts, and vesting accounts
