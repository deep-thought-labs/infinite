## Run a Node

### Option 1: Using Drive (Recommended)

The easiest way to run a node is using **[Drive](https://github.com/deep-thought-labs/drive)**, the infrastructure management client for **Infinite Improbability Chain**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deep-thought-labs/drive.git
cd drive/services/infinite-mainnet
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec infinite-mainnet node-ui
```

Drive provides a graphical interface and simplified node management. [Learn more →](https://github.com/deep-thought-labs/drive)

### Option 2: Direct Installation

For direct installation from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deep-thought-labs/infinite.git
cd infinite
./local_node.sh
```
